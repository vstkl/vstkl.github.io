## What essentially is linux

Linux is, let's say open-source alternative to windows. The actual definition of what linux is or isn't is slightly more complex, but for sake of this article's main audience shall be Windows users willing to migrate to Linux.

The pro's of Linux compared to Windows are for example:

- **less resource consumption** - linux with fully working DE(Desktop Environment)

- **customization** - linux systems usually come with predefined User Interfaces, but you're more than welcome to change whatever you want. Also there are extensive resources documenting how to do whatever you desire

- **no tracking** - Windows inherently spies on you, for sake of alleged "performance optimisation". That's not the case on linux. No telemetry, no tracking, and if you're extra paranoid, you can go for security hardening with advanced firewalls([ufw](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW), [nftables](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Nftables) and some more)

- **better security** - Linux systems get their security patches faster, because they use native versions of libraries providing security, such as

- **opensource** - anything that runs on your computer can be audited, and therefore verify it runs there with ***NO*** malicious intentions

- **FREE** - need I say more?

## So what's this "distro"?

Distro is essantially a composed package of linux with some programs, that allow for creating one-stop-shop way of getting the system to install - yes, you can install core linux and work from there,
but for starters it's best to use pre-built distributions of linux that are verified to work out of the box.

### List of reccomended distros for beginners

- [Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) - The most matured and easy Linux for everyday usage - based on #debian
- [Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/) - Slightly more tweaked, most Windows-like from the List, based on #debian as well
- [Garuda](https://garudalinux.org/) - My personal favourite, based on #arch, focused on gaming and performance, very easily extensible using sources provided by glorious [archwiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org)
- [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/) - Also very reccomended for gaming, based on #fedora
- - provides Nobara-42-Steam-HTPC - SteamOS-like experience,
- [endeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) - more of a generic usage OS, based on #arch, very extensible and easy to use as well
- [bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/) - specifically gaming distro - allows you to pre-define the hardware you'll be running it on, allowing for faster install times and less garbage built into the distro - optimising used storage and potentially performance

## Desktop Environment

Well… Desktop Environments (DE for short) are vast nowadays, and choosing one is almost as important as choosing your distro. Think of a DE as the face of your Linux system — it defines how your windows look, how your menus behave, what animations you see, and how your workflow feels overall. The beauty of Linux is that you can pick whichever DE fits your vibe… and if you ever get bored, you can just switch it out without reinstalling the whole system.

### GNOME

GNOME is the “default” experience for many distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, Pop!_OS). It’s clean, minimalistic, very consistent, and packed with productivity-focused features.
Some people love it for its simplicity; others complain it’s too different from Windows. But it’s rock-solid and great for daily use.

### KDE Plasma

The king of customization. Plasma lets you modify literally anything — from window borders to animations to button placements. You want your desktop to look like Windows? Sure. Like macOS? Easy. Like a sci-fi control panel from 2083? Done.
Despite being feature-rich, it’s surprisingly lightweight and efficient.

### XFCE

XFCE is the “lightweight but functional” choice. It’s extremely fast, low on resources, and ideal for older hardware or users who just want a no-nonsense environment.
Think Windows XP vibes, but with more customization and less bloat.

### LXQt / LXDE

Even lighter than XFCE. Perfect for really old laptops, Raspberry Pi builds, or minimalists who want pure performance over fancy visuals.

### Cinnamon

Linux Mint’s flagship desktop. If you’re coming from Windows and want an experience that feels familiar right away, Cinnamon is probably your best pick. Polished, stable, and beginner-friendly.

### MATE

A continuation of the older GNOME 2 style — traditional menus, panels at the top or bottom, and a straightforward interface. Great for users who prefer a classic desktop metaphor.

### Budgie

A modern, elegant DE that aims to combine simplicity with visual appeal. Smooth animations, clean layout, and not overwhelming for new users.
If you want something pretty but not overkill, Budgie is a solid choice.

## Dictionary

- DE - Desktop Environment
- kernel - the core of Operating System, providing ways to communicate with the hardware
- UI/User Interface - the stuff you see on the screen, the pretty windows, the decorators of windows and everything around it.
