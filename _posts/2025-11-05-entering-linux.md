## What essentially is linux

Linux is, let's say open-source alternative to windows. The actual definition of what linux is or isn't is slightly more complex, but for sake of this article's main audience shall be Windows users willing to migrate to Linux.

The pro's of Linux compared to Windows are for example:

- **less resource consumption** - linux with fully working DE(Desktop Environment)

- **customization** - linux systems usually come with predefined User Interfaces, but you're more than welcome to change whatever you want. Also there are extensive resources documenting how to do whatever you desire

- **no tracking** - Windows inherently spies on you, for sake of alleged "performance optimisation". That's not the case on linux. No telemetry, no tracking, and if you're extra paranoid, you can go for security hardening with advanced firewalls([ufw](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW), [nftables](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Nftables) and some more)

- **better security** - Linux systems get their security patches faster, because they use native versions of libraries providing security, such as

- **opensource** - anything that runs on your computer can be audited, and therefore verify it runs there with ***NO*** malicious intentions

- **FREE** - need I say more?

## So what's this "distro"?

Distro is essantially a composed package of linux with some programs, that allow for creating one-stop-shop way of getting the system to install - yes, you can install core linux and work from there,
but for starters it's best to use pre-built distributions of linux that are verified to work out of the box.

## Dictionary

- DE - Desktop Environment
- kernel - the core of Operating System, providing ways to communicate with the hardware
- UI/User Interface - the stuff you see on the screen, the pretty windows, the decorators of windows and everything around it.
